# Setting up Tableau Sparkler for Salesforce
Tableau provides a solution for embedding content into Salesforce, called [Sparkler](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2015/2/salesforce-canvas-connector-tableau-server-online-live-36973).  Sparkler is a web app, which lives on its own server, that sits between Salesforce and your Tableau Server.  Sparkler allows for single sign on using [Trusted Tickets](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/trusted_auth.htm), so that users logged into Salesforce are automatically logged into your Tableau Server.  It also makes it easier to embed tableau dashboards into various pages within Salesforce.  Tableau provides some documentation on how to get Sparkler setup, but it's a manual process.  This project aims to automate as much as possible, and make it easier to get started using Tableau, Sparkler, and Salesforce.

# Setup

## Before you start
You'll need to have the following, in order to complete the setup
1. A __Salesforce System Administrator__ login, in order to add Sparkler as a connected app in Salesforce
2. Access to TSM on your Tableau Server, as well as being able to perform a server restart
3. Either an AWS account with permission to spin up new instances, or a linux server with a SSL certificate (not self-signed)

## Step 1: Create the Connected App in Salesforce
The first thing to do, is create a _connected app_ in Salesforce.  Login to Salesforce and goto the __Setup__ app, using the dropdown menu at the top right of the screen.

Using the left navigation search bar, navigate to the __App Manager__ page and click on the __New Connected App__ button.
![Image of app manager](/screenshots/sf-setup-2.png)

On the next page, you'll need to add a few details about this new connected app.  Fill in the Connected App name, API name, and contact email with whatever values you like.  Just know that whatever app name you choose, will be needed when embedding later on.  The other important sections are for API and Canvas App Settings.

For the API section, you need to add a __callback URL__ witch will follow this format: `https://<your-sparkler-server>/sparkler/keepAlive`.  You will also need to add __Access your basic information(id, profile, email, address, phone)__ to the list of __Selected OAuth Scopes__.
![Image of new app wizard 1](/screenshots/sf-connected-app-1.png)

For the Canvas App Settings, you should make sure the __Canvas__ option is checked, and the __Access Method__ is set to __Signed Request(POST)__.  The __Canvas App URL__ should match the following format: `https://<your-sparkler-server>/sparkler/sfdc/canvas`.  Lastly, make sure __Chatter Feed, Publisher, Visualforce Page__ are in the __Selected__ list of __Locations__.  Once these settings are entered, you can click save.
![Image of new app wizard 2](/screenshots/sf-connected-app-2.png)

Next, we need to add some permission profiles to our connected app.  Use the search navigation to goto the __Connected Apps__ page and click the edit button next to your sparkler app.  Change the __Permitted Users__ setting to __Admin approved users are pre-authorized__ and click save.  
![Image of edit app settings 1](/screenshots/sf-connected-app-3.png)

This should refresh the page, and you'll be back to the list of all apps.  Click on the name of your sparkler app (blue link), and you should now be able to click on __Manage Profiles__.  Add at least one profile, like __System Administrator__.
![Image of edit app settings 2](/screenshots/sf-connected-app-4.png)

At this point, everything is setup and you just need to get the consumer secret of your app.  Use the search navigation to get back to the __App Manager__ page and click on your Sparkler app to view the details.  Click on the button to show you the consumer secret and make sure to copy this string of text, as you will need this for setting up sparkler.

## Step 2: Install the Sparkler web app on a server

### Option 1: Using your infrastructure for Sparkler
This option is applicable if your organization has its own servers (hyper-v, vmware, physical machines, etc) and you want to host the Sparkler web app.  In this case, you can use the setup.sh bash script to automate the installation and configuration of your sparkler server.

### Option 2: Using AWS to host Sparkler
This option is applicable if your organization leverages AWS as a hosting platform.  In this case, you can use the cloudformation template to spin up a new EC2 instance and automatically install/setup Sparkler.  Before using Cloudformation, you need to define a load balancer to sit between Salesforce and your Sparkler instance.  In the AWS console, navigate to the EC2 service and use the left navigation to get to the __Load Balancers__ page.  Click the blue button to __Create Load Balancer__, and select an __Application Load Balancer__.  You should have listeners for HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443), and assign the load balancer to your availability zones.

![Image of create-load-balancer 1](/screenshots/aws-elb-1.png)

Next, specify a certificate to use for HTTPS communications.  If you've never done this before, you can see [this link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html) on how to create SSL certificates using __AWS Certificate Manager__.

![Image of create-load-balancer 2](/screenshots/aws-elb-2.png)

Next, specify the security groups to use for this load balancer.  You'll want to ensure inbound TCP traffic to ports 80 & 443 is allowed by the security group(s) you select.  Lastly, create a new target group to track the list of EC2 instances that should receive traffic.  This target group should have the protocol set to __HTTP__ and port set to __8080__.  The Cloudformation script will use these default settings to setup Tomcat and the Sparkler app on your EC2 instance.  

![Image of create-load-balancer 3](/screenshots/aws-elb-3.png)

On the _Register Targets_ page, you can leave this blank and just click _Review_.  Then click the blue __Create__ button to create the new Load Balancer and Target Group.  Now that the load balancer is created, there is one more setting to change.  On the Load Balancers page in AWS Console, find your new load balancer and click on the __Listeners__ tab.  Click on the check box next to the __HTTP:80__ listener and then click __Edit__.  Update the default action, to always __Redirect to__ HTTPS on port 443.  This will ensure that if anyone types in _http://<your-sparkler-server>_, that traffic will be routed automatically to _https://<your-sparker-server>_.
![Image of create-load-balancer 4](/screenshots/aws-elb-4.png)
  
When you use the Cloudformation template, you will need your new load balancer's target group ARN.
![Image of create-load-balancer 5](/screenshots/aws-elb-5.png)

You will also need an __IAM Role__, to assign to the EC2 instances for Sparkler.  You can use an existing role, or [create a new one](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html#roles-creatingrole-service-console) but make sure your IAM role has the following permissions:
* ElasticLoadBalancingReadOnly
* ElasticLoadBalancingFullAccess
* ResourceGroupsandTagEditorReadOnlyAccess
* ResourceGroupsandTagEditorFullAccess
* AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole
* AmazonEC2FullAccess

Now we are ready to use the Cloudformation template.  Search the AWS Console for __Cloudformation__ and use the left navigation to get to the __Stacks__ page.  Click the button to __Create Stack - with new resources__.  Step 1 is just to select your template file and click next.
![Image of create-cloud-formation 1](/screenshots/aws-cf-1.png)

The next page is just for entering your parameters.  The table below, outlines what should be used for each parameter:

| Parameter        | Type         | Description |
| ---              | ---          | ---         |
| Instance Type    | AWS | Instance type for the sparkler server, the default should be fine |
| Subnet ID        | AWS | Choose a subnet, in which to deploy the Sparker server |
| Security Groups  | AWS | Specify which security groups to apply to the EC2 instance.  Ports 80 and 443 should be allowed for inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic. |
| Target Group ARN | AWS | Copy/paste the ARN of your new load balancer's target group |
| IAM Role         | AWS | Type in the name of the IAM Role to assign to the EC2 instance |
| Key Pair         | AWS | Key pairs are required to creating any EC2 instance, so that you can actually connect to it via SSH |
| Consumer Secret       | Salesforce | Copy/Paste the consumer secret from your Salesforce Connected App |
| User Identifier Field | Salesforce | Select which method should be used to map Salesforce users to Tableau users |
| Allowed Email Domains | Salesforce | If selecting _signedIdentity_ as the User Identifier Field, you must specify the email domain(s) to allow (ex. _@company.com_ |
| Tableau Server Host         | Tableau | Name or IP address of your Tableau Server (do not include `https://`) |
| Tableau Server Port         | Tableau | Port of your Tableau Server (usually 443 for SSL) |
| Tableau Server SSL          | Tableau | Does your end users access Tableau Server over SSL? |
| Use Trusted Tickets         | Tableau | Should we use Trusted Tickets to enable SSO? |
| Tableau User for Testing    | Tableau | Any Tableau User, that we can use to verify SSO is working |
| Enable Sparkler Status Page | Tableau | Should we enable the status page for Sparker?  Mark yes for testing, but disable this in production. |

The last two pages can be left as is, then click on the orange __Create Stack__ button.  Once started, the events tab should show you the progress of your cloudformation stack.  You should see a green checkmark next to the stack name, once the process is complete.

You can get the Sparkler server's public IP from the Outputs tab, which can be used for setting up Trusted Tickets on your Tableau Server.

## Step 3: Enable Trusted Ticket authentication on your Tableau Server.
Tableau provides instructions for how to setup trusted ticket authentication, which can be found [here](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/trusted_auth_trustIP.htm).  You'll just need the IP of your Sparkler server, in order to add it as a _trusted ip_ on your Tableau Server.  Once you've configured Tableau Server for Trusted Tickets from Sparkler, you should check Sparkler's status page at `https://<sparkler-server>/sparkler/status`
